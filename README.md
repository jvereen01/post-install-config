In osTicket, you can configure roles, departments, and teams to streamline your support system. Navigate to the Admin Panel, then go to Agents and select Roles to set up roles such as "Supreme Admin." Next, configure departments under Admin Panel -> Agents -> Departments, specifying roles like "System Administrators." Finally, organize teams by accessing Admin Panel -> Agents -> Teams, and define teams such as "Level I Support" and "Level II Support." These configurations help define access levels and responsibilities within osTicket, optimizing your support structure for efficient workflow management.
